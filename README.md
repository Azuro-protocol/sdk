# Web Tools

Welcome to the Azuro Web Tools repository, your one-stop shop for building applications atop the Azuro Protocol. This repository houses libraries designed to streamline your development process.

Here is a brief overview of the three main libraries:

1. [SDK](/packages/sdk): A comprehensive suite of utilities and hooks that facilitates interaction with Azuro contracts. It allows for both reading and writing data.
2. [Data](/packages/data): This library includes GraphQL schemas and hooks that make fetching data from the Azuro Subgraph a breeze. It also includes a pre-configured Apollo environment for React and NextJS applications.
3. [UI](/packages/ui): A rich library of components designed specifically for creating betting applications. It provides a plethora of features including a list of events, betslip, bet history, and more.
